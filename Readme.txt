Explanation of the Java code
TL;DR
The Java code defines three classes: Transaction, RewardsCalculator, and RewardsController. The Transaction class represents a transaction with a customer ID and an amount. The RewardsCalculator class calculates reward points for each customer based on their transactions. The RewardsController class is a REST controller that receives a list of transactions and returns a map of customer IDs and their corresponding reward points.

Explanation
The Java code defines three classes: Transaction, RewardsCalculator, and RewardsController.

Transaction class
The Transaction class represents a transaction with a customer ID and an amount. The class has two private fields: customerId and amount. The class has a constructor that takes a customer ID and an amount as arguments and sets the corresponding fields. The class also has two getter methods: getCustomerId() and getAmount().

RewardsCalculator class
The RewardsCalculator class calculates reward points for each customer based on their transactions. The class has two private static final fields: REWARD_RATE_ABOVE_100 and REWARD_RATE_BETWEEN_50_AND_100, which represent the reward rates for transactions above $100 and between $50 and $100, respectively. The class has a public method calculateRewards() that takes a list of Transaction objects as an argument and returns a map of customer IDs and their corresponding reward points.

The calculateRewards() method iterates through each transaction in the list and calculates the reward points for the transaction based on its amount. If the amount is above $100, the method calculates the reward points for the portion of the amount above $100 using the REWARD_RATE_ABOVE_100 rate. If the amount is between $50 and $100, the method calculates the reward points for the portion of the amount between $50 and $100 using the REWARD_RATE_BETWEEN_50_AND_100 rate. The method then adds the reward points to the corresponding customer's list in the rewards map.

RewardsController class
The RewardsController class is a REST controller that receives a list of transactions and returns a map of customer IDs and their corresponding reward points. The class has a constructor that takes a RewardsCalculator object as an argument and sets the corresponding field. The class has a calculateRewards() method that is annotated with @PostMapping("/rewards"), which maps the method to the /rewards endpoint. The method takes a list of Transaction objects as a request body and returns a map of customer IDs and their corresponding reward points using the RewardsCalculator object.
